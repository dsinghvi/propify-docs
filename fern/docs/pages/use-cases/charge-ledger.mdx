## Relevant Business Types

Resident benefits & amenities, rent payments, security deposit alternatives, services that charge resident a fee.

## Description

Your business may find it valuable to add charges directly to a resident's payment ledger. This allows residents to pay for your service from within the property management software while you can collect fees from the property management company. 

## Steps

**Proptech generates a charge with associated metadata**
<CodeBlock title="Example transaction for $50.00">
```bash 
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.propexo.com/v1/transactions \
  --data '{
    "integration_id": "<integration_id>",
    "invoice_date": "2023-07-15",
    "due_date": "2023-08-01",
    "memo": "This is a charge for pet insurance",
    "lines": [
        {
            "x_accounting_entity_type": "abc",
            "x_accounting_entity_id": 123,
            "x_gl_account_id": 456,
            "amount_in_cents": 5000
        }
    ]
}'
```
</CodeBlock>

**That charge is pushed into the resident payment ledger, and will be collected by the property manager via the payment portal**
