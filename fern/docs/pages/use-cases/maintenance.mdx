## Description
If your company fulfills work orders filed by residents or site staff within a property management system, you will need to ingest these work orders on an ongoing basis and then update them as you resolve the issues.

## Steps

**Read an existing work order**

**Update work order**

<CodeBlock title = "PUT /<work_order_id>">
```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url 'https://api.propexo.com/v1/work-orders/<work_order_id>' \
  --data '{
    "invoice_date": "2023-07-15",
    "due_date": "2023-08-01",
    "memo": "This is a charge for pet insurance",
    "lines": [
        {
            "x_accounting_entity_type": "abc",
            "x_accounting_entity_id": 123,
            "x_gl_account_id": 456,
            "amount_in_cents": 5000
        }
    ]
}'
```
</CodeBlock>

**That charge is pushed into the resident payment ledger, and will be collected by the property manager via the payment portal**
