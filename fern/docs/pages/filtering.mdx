## Overview

Use query parameters to filter results on requests that return arrays of objects. Query parameters are optional.

## Example 

One example of filtering is finding all residents associated with a lease (by the Propexo lease ID). This can be done by filtering on the `lease_id` property.

<CodeBlock title="Example filter">
```json 
// GET /v1/residents?lease_id=123456
```
</CodeBlock>

Note: When filtering using external IDs (e.g. `x_*`), you will be required to supply the Propexo integration ID (`integration_id`) and the external property ID (`x_property_id`) as part of your query string. This is to ensure that you are only getting records associated with your intended result set â€” in an effort to account for property management systems using auto-incrementing integers as their IDs.
