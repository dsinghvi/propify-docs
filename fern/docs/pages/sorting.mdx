## Overview

Propexo provides a sorting mechanism that can be used to sort results by one or more fields. The `orderBy` parameter is used to define the sort order. The `orderBy` parameter is an array of objects, where each object contains a `field` and `direction` property.

## `order-by` Query Parameter

The `order-by` parameter is used to define the sort order. It is a combination of `field_name` and `direction` separated by a colon. For example, if you wanted to sort by the `id` field in ascending order, you would use `order-by=id:asc` as a query parameter in the URL. If you wanted to sort by the `id` field in descending order, you would use `order-by=id:desc` as a query parameter in the URL.

If you wanted to sort by multiple fields, you would provide a comma-separated list of fields and directions. For example, if you wanted to sort by the `id` field in ascending order, and then by the `name` field in descending order, you would use `order-by=id:asc,name:desc` as a query parameter in the URL.
